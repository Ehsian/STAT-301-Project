    "## Deliverable 2 (Individual Assignment 1) - Data and Questions\n",

    "### About the Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group (group 21) will be working with [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/predict-diabities), as assigned. Our dataset is related to diabetes, and includes diagnostic measurements/explanatory variables that may or may not be related to diabetes. Compiled onto Kaggle by Aman Chauhan, our data originally comes from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), who collected this data with the objective of being able to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain measurements of variables included in the dataset. All patients from which the data was collected are women of at least 21 years of age, of Pima Indian heritage. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Characterization of the Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset, accessed through the file \"diabetes.csv\", contains 768 observations and 9 variables. Within the file, 7/9 variables are integer data types, while 2/9 variables are decimal data types. Out of these variables, 8/9 are independent medical predictor/explanatory variables, and 1/9 is the dependent categorical target/response variable. This response variable is indicated by the \"Outcome\" column in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reiterate, the dataset contains the following 9 variables: (Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, Outcome)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a full descriptive summary of each variable within the dataset. (Numerical summaries collected before tidying)\n",
    "- Pregnancies: The count of pregnancies that the individual has had.\n",
    "    - Data Type: Quantitative (Integer)\n",
    "    - Mean: 3.85\n",
    "    - SD: 3.37\n",
    "- Glucose: The blood glucose level of the individual in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter).\n",
    "    - Data Type: Quantitative (Integer)\n",
    "    - Mean: 121\n",
    "    - SD: 32\n",
    "- BloodPressure: The blood pressure measurement of the individual in mm Hg (millimeters of mercury).\n",
    "    - Data Type: Quantitative (Integer)\n",
    "    - Mean: 69.1\n",
    "    - SD: 19.3\n",
    "- SkinThickness: The skin thickness of the individual in mm (millimeters).\n",
    "    - Data Type: Quantitative (Integer)\n",
    "    - Mean: 20.5\n",
    "    - SD: 15.9\n",
    "- Insulin: The blood insulin level of the individual in $\\mu$ U/mL.\n",
    "    - Data Type: Quantitative (Integer)\n",
    "    - Mean: 79.8\n",
    "    - SD: 115\n",
    "- BMI: The body mass index of the individual in kg/m^2 (weight (kg) over height (m) squared).\n",
    "    - Data Type: Quantitative (Decimal)\n",
    "    - Mean: 32\n",
    "    - SD: 7.88\n",
    "- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function scoring the likelihood of diabetes based on family history (higher value indicates higher likelihood of diabetes).\n",
    "    - Data Type: Quantitative (Decimal)\n",
    "    - Mean: 0.47\n",
    "    - SD: 0.33\n",
    "- Age: The age of the individual.\n",
    "    - Data Type: Quantitative (Integer)\n",
    "    - Mean: 33.2\n",
    "    - SD: 11.8\n",
    "- Outcome: The final result on whether the individual has diabetes (0 = Does Not Have Diabetes, 1 = Has Diabetes).\n",
    "    - Data Type: Categorical (Y/N stored as Integer)\n",
    "    - Mean: 0.35\n",
    "    - SD: 0.48\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional point to keep note of is that although the data does not have any \"N/A\" data points, there exists some invalid entries in some certain columns (An example of this is entry/row #8, in which a blood pressure of 0 is recorded). Thus, when moving forward for exploratory data analysis, we will need to filter out entries that may be invalid for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Question: \n",
    "\n",
    "##### With only age and BMI, can we accurately predict whether or not an individual has diabetes?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Response variable: `Outcome` (Whether or not an individual has diabetes)\n",
    "- Explanatory variables: `Age` and `BMI`\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project, we aim to answer the above question by focusing on prediction. We will train a classifer that can predict whether or not an individual is expected to have diabetes based on the following 2 explanatory variables: `Age` and `BMI`. I chose these two variables specifically because although including the other possible explanatory variables in the classifier can potentially increase its prediction success rate, I believe that focusing on age and BMI is more practical for the use of the general public. This is because most people do not know things such as their blood glucose level or their blood insulin level. However, they are likely to know their age, weight, and height. Thus, everyday people can use the classifier that we trained for this project to predict whether or not they are expected to have diabetes based on factors that they themselves know.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, through training a classifier/predictor using our dataset, we can answer the question proposed above, since we have access to a reasonably large dataset that contains entries using both of our explanatory variables and our response variable. Additionally, for the response variable, at a glance we should have sufficient instances of 'has diabetes' and 'does not have diabetes', such that we can train our classifier."
